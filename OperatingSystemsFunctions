Managing Resources - What are they?
In the terms of an OS (Operating System), these are the resources used to manage all connected hardware.
What Hardware? such as keyboard, mouse, headphones, and the like. 

Graphical User Interface, or GUI: This GUI (get it?), makes all of our lives easier. 
The GUI is what we experience when we are prompted through program downloads, updates or simply opening a problem.
Imagine if we had to know exactly what and why we were using all these functions - thankfully those who design these know just that!
